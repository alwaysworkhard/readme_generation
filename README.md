# Experimentation on Multi-Task Representation Learning in Constrained Linear Contextual Bandits
## Synthetic Data Experiments (varying alpha)
### In the Synthetic directory, we evaluate our methods through experiments with synthetic data. You can test different alpha parameter values by executing alpha.ipynb in the Comparison_Alpha folder. Modify the alpha parameter to get experimental results for different alpha values (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 0.7). Create separate folders with the following names: Alpha = 0.3, Alpha = 0.5, and Alpha = 0.7. Save the generated results for each alpha value in the appropriate folders. After generating these results, use the plot.ipynb file to visualize the plots. 
## Synthetic Data Experiments (compare with benchmark)
### The Compare with Benchmark algorithms directory contains comparisons to benchmarks with different variables. You can test for different parameters (d, T) by executing Compare.ipynb in the Comparison_Benchmarks folder. Modify the parameters to get experimental results for different combination parameters. For each parameter combination, create separate folders with the following names: Dimension = 100, Dimension = 125, and Dimension = 150. Save the results for each set of parameters in the appropriate folders. Then, run the plot.ipynb file to create comparative plots.
